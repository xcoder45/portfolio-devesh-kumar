                      About Me :
                  </h2>

              <p>
                  A Software Engineer and Developer...
              </p>
              <p>
                  I am a passionate self taught developer
                  (which is quite a subjective thing as i learnt from
                  teachers on youtube so does that really counts?
                  idk). Think of me as a creative problem solver with a love for tech, especially when it comes to bringing ideas to life with C++, JavaScript, and React.
                  Letâ€™s connect and create something unforgettable.....
